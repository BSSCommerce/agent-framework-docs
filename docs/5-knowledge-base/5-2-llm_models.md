## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. The LLM landscape is diverse, with models varying in size, architecture, capabilities, and licensing. Understanding this landscape is crucial for selecting the right model for specific applications. The year 2025 has been a pivotal year, marked by a shift towards more efficient, specialized, and agent-first models.

## Model Classification

LLMs can be classified based on several key attributes:
